# TargetDrop
Target Drop

A tiny precision game built with Angular (standalone) and Firebase. Press **Drop** to release a ball; the closer it lands to the target’s center, the higher the round score.  
Every round is saved to Cloud Firestore and each user’s **total score** is accumulated across rounds.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.1.
